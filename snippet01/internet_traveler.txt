This HyperText database you have at your fingertips holds
the most of the more important information that two certified
netsurfers have gathered in their time. We have made no deletions to
the original database that we made. For example , we didn't erase the
BBSftp site branch etc'.  This product is not even a `ware` . it's
just a convenient way to organise your net sessions, with a DOS TSR.
All the USEFUL info is right there for you.

	We have made no deletions in this database comparing to the one
we use personally. There are no limitations to the distribution or
usage of this database. In fact, distribute it freely. All we ask in
return is that if you have one or more address or info you think will
find their place in this database, then please send the info to the
address mentioned six lines up.  ( Yes.. That's the one) . If it is
not a synonym for one already appearing, then it will be included in
the next edition.
